# Breathless at CEH: A curious case of Christmas party

Â© 2021 by [Ebrahim Afyounian](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0755-0131).

This work was done at the [Computational Biology group](https://research.tuni.fi/computational-biology/), [Tamper University](https://www.tuni.fi/en), Finland, to showcase the use of gamification (and more specifically the use of digital escape rooms) for teaching in the higher education context.

To our knowledge, this is the first bioinformatics digital escape rooms (and hopefully, this is not the last).

The digital escape room can be accessed [here](https://eafyounian.github.io/Breathless_at_CEH/) freely on the GitHub Pages.

&#x1F4DD; If you have 10 minutes of time to spare, please fill in [this](https://forms.gle/hZSwTc2whpknnB4W7) questionnaire. Your feedback is very important for us to improve this work.

If you are interested you can check my short [presentation](https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/eafyounian/presentations/master/10052021_Digital_escape_room.md) on the ideas behind using digital escape rooms in teaching bioinformatics.
