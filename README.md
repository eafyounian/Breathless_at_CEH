This work was done at the [Computational Biology group](https://research.tuni.fi/computational-biology/), [Tamper University](https://www.tuni.fi/en), Finland, to showcase the use of gamification (and more specifically the use of digital escape rooms) for teaching in the higher education context.

To our knowledge, this is the first bioinformatics digital escape rooms (and hopefully, this is not the last).
